So, this was my attempt at making a chip8 emulator it was fun personal project, if anyone wants to make
one them self you use my code as refrence(don't copy everything),
if you want to test this code: 
                                 ./chip8
if you find any errors let me know.
i have provide a pdf of the cowgod's chip-8 technical refrence i have used this alot while makeing this
(this is like the first time i made a solo project using c++)
